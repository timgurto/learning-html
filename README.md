#Course to teach HTML

##Required installations: 
**Git:** https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 

**Some kind of text editor:** Here you have a range of options. Lately I've been playing with VSCode, which is quite nice. 

##Setting up this project. 
1. Create a github account (or log in to your github account if you have one). Good job! 

2. This is the project that you'll want to make changes to. BUT - you don't own it. So we want to fork the repository into your own account and then you can work on your own fork. In the top right corner of this page, there's a `fork` button. Click it. 

3. You should now have a fork on your own account. Hooray! You can tell easily from looking at the URL. If it has your username in it, something has gone very right.

4. Now we want to get the project on to your local machine. You will see a large green button that says `Clone or download`. Click it, and you will see a URL in an input field. Copy that input field. That's the URL for your git project. 

5. Open your terminal program. 
    * Mac: Your terminal is called, helpfully, Terminal. I've been using iTerm and enjoying it.
    * PC: Your terminal is called cmd. 

6. To clone the project to your local machine, enter `git clone https://github.com/[your user name]/learning-html.git` (it the URL will be in your clipboard) into your terminal. 
7. You now have a local version of the project. Let's get started. 

Once you have reached this point, put your hand up and ask your teacher for more instructions.
